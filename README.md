# SARI-Farm-Analysis
# Overview
This analysis was conducted to evaluate agricultural productivity, resource utilization, and efficiency across different crop types, seasons, and soil conditions.
The primary questions addressed were:
- Which crops deliver the highest yields relative to farm area?
- How efficiently are water, fertilizer, and irrigation methods being used?
- How does yield distribution vary across seasons and soil types?
- Where can improvements or optimizations be made to increase overall agricultural productivity?

# Tool:
- Ms Excel

 # Key Findings
- 📊 High-Yield Crops
Carrot (36.63 tons), Tomato (33.63 tons), and Soybean (32.31 tons) are the top-performing crops by average yield.
- 📊 Resource-Intensive Crops
Tomato consumes the most water (440.88 km³), followed by Barley and Cotton.Barley uses the most fertilizer (34.18 tons), followed by Cotton and Tomato.
- 📊 Irrigation Efficiency
Drip irrigation shows the highest efficiency (13.41), outperforming other methods like Rain-fed (7.75) and Sprinkler (7.57).
- 📊 Seasonal Performance
Summer accounts for nearly half (47.61%) of the total yield, making it the most productive season. Winter contributes only 20.06%, suggesting potential underutilization.
- 📊 Soil Productivity
Clay soil yields the highest (350.59 tons), followed by Silty soils and Loamy.
Peaty soil underperforms significantly (93.88 tons).

 I was able to deliver data-driven recommendations relevant to SARI Farms, providing ways to boost crop yields, optimize resource usage, and enhance overall agricultural efficiency.

# 📝 Recommendations
- 💡 Expand High-Yield Crops
 It is recommended to increase the planting of top-performing crops such as carrot, tomato, and soybean, as these deliver the highest yields and make the best use of available land.
- 💡 Reduce Water and Fertilizer Waste
 Careful review is advised for crops like barley and cotton, which consume large amounts of water and fertilizer. Consider improving resource management for these crops or reassessing their overall value to the operation.
- 💡 Invest in Drip Irrigation Systems
 Since drip irrigation has shown the highest efficiency, expanding its use across farms is strongly recommended. This approach will help conserve water and boost productivity.
- 💡 Strengthen Winter Season Production
 Efforts should be made to enhance winter season yields by introducing winter-friendly crops or exploring technologies such as greenhouses that allow better use of the winter months.
- 💡 Address Low-Yield Soil Areas
 Conducting soil assessments and exploring improvement methods, such as soil treatments or better drainage, could help raise productivity in these areas.

# Conclusion
This analysis has provided a comprehensive overview of crop performance, resource efficiency, and seasonal and soil-based yield variations across SARI Farms. By leveraging Excel for deep exploration and visualization, we uncovered critical insights that point to actionable opportunities. Prioritizing high-yield crops, adopting efficient irrigation systems, and addressing low-performing soils and seasons can significantly enhance overall agricultural productivity. With these data-driven strategies in place, SARI Farms is well-positioned to maximize output, reduce waste, and make more informed decisions moving forward. Data isn't just numbers it’s a pathway to smarter, more sustainable farming.
